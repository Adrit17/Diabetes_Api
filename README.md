## Overview

This project is a **diabetes prediction system** built with a TensorFlow-based neural network. It takes clinical patient data as input, scales and preprocesses it, then predicts the likelihood of diabetes. The API is built using **FastAPI** to provide real-time predictions.

The model handles common medical data preprocessing tasks including unit conversion (mg/dL to mmol/L), class imbalance, and threshold tuning to maximize F1-score for robust diagnosis.

## Features

- Trained deep neural network with dropout and L2 regularization  
- Scales and preprocesses patient clinical data  
- Automatically converts common lab units (mg/dL â†’ mmol/L)  
- Threshold tuning for optimal precision-recall balance  
- Real-time prediction API using FastAPI  
- Easy to extend or retrain with your own dataset
